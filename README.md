# My solutions for the Numerical Computing homeworks
## University of Bologna, 2023/2024

This repository contains the work done during my numerical computing course. It includes seven labs and an oral exam preparation file.

### Labs

The labs cover a range of topics and were completed throughout the course. They include:

1. **Numpy Functions and Plotting**: An exploration of various Numpy functions and data visualization techniques.
2. **Matrices and Norms**: A deep dive into matrix operations and norms.
3. **Image Compression with SVD**: Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for image compression.
4. **Least Squares Problem**: Solving the least squares problem.
5. **Roots of Functions**: Finding the roots of various functions.
6. **Gradient Descent**: Implementing and understanding the gradient descent algorithm.
7. **Image Reconstruction**: Reconstructing images using various techniques.

### Oral exam preparation

In addition to the labs, this repository also contains an `oralExam` file. 
This file includes all the oral exam questions and the exercises I worked on in preparation for the exam. 
The file is also available in HTML format [here](https://lorenzoperonese.github.io/lab_02023/oralExam.html).
